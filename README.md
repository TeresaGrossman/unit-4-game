This Crystals game is a fun and interactive game for web browsers that will dynamically update the HTML page with the jQuery library.  
The player will be given a random number at the start of the game.  Each of the four crystals(buttons) will also be assigned a random number.  When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific number the the player's total score.  The amount for each crystal is hidden until the player clicks on it.  They will then be able to deduce the value each crystal is given and hopefully will WIN when their total score matches the random number assigned at the beginning of the game.  If not....they LOSE.  The game restarts after the player either wins or loses.  The page will not refresh, showing total wins and losses along with a new random number to match and new random numbers assigned to each crystal.  Good Luck!
